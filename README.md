# Advent of Code 2019

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This is my solutions for 2019. I use the current version of PHP with PhpStan set to level 9, and php-cs-fixer using the PER-CS2.0 ruleset.

As requested by the creator of Advent of Code, I will only link the daily puzzles from here, but not include puzzle texts and my input files.
